//C and C++ compilation consists of a preprocessor that passes through the code
//first and makes a number of substitutions. The driectives start with #
#include <stdio.h> //This is a platform dependanct header to facilitate the use of stdin and stdout
//Can compile code in one go if had mulitple implementations: gcc task1.c task1-function.c -o task1
//or run in two stages: gcc -c task1.c -o task1.o and gcc -c task1-function.c -o task1-function.o
//and then you can link those object files to a single exe binary: gcc task1.o task1-function.o -o task1

    A definition tells the compiler the name and type of a property, and allocates some memory somewhere for it
    Typically variable declarations are also definitions* because where we make a variable definitions will depend on where space is allocated in memory

    /* * The stack is a region of memory that stores data and the memory addresses of the active subroutines in a program.
    * It is automatically managed by the compiler and the CPU.
    * The stack grows and shrinks as functions are called and return.
    * The stack is used for local variables, function parameters, and return addresses.
    * It is efficient for fast memory allocation and deallocation, but has a fixed size.
    * 
    * The heap, on the other hand, is a region of memory that is used for dynamic memory allocation.
    * It is managed by the programmer using functions like malloc, calloc, and realloc.
    * The heap is used for storing data structures, arrays, and objects that have a variable size or need to persist beyond the lifetime of a function.
